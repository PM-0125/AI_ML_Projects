# Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART1) Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART1) algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook. The implementation includes three different approaches:

1. **Modified ART1 Algorithm**: 
    - Custom Binarizing Function
    - Different Weight Initialization Update Method
    - Ability to Limit the Number of Maximum Clusters using `max_clusture` Parameter
    - Analyze Vigilance Function to Store Results for Each Parameter
    - Plot Confusion Matrix Function to Visualize Confusion Matrix
    - Accumulation of Functions into a Main Function for Simplicity
    - Printing Cluster IDs Assigned During Each Vigilance Parameter

2. **Standard ART1 Algorithm (with Libraries)**:
    - Implementation from Scratch
    - Uses Available Libraries for Some Functionalities

3. **Standard ART1 Algorithm (with NumPy)**:
    - Pure NumPy Implementation
    - No External Libraries Used

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/art1-implementation.git
    cd art1-implementation
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Navigate to the `art1_implementation.ipynb` file and open it.

3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the implementations and visualize the results.

## Key Features

### Modified ART1 Algorithm

- **Custom Binarizing Function**: Customizable binarization process.
- **Weight Initialization Update Method**: Different approach to weight initialization.
- **Maximum Clusters Limitation**: Parameter to limit the number of clusters.
- **Analyze Vigilance Function**: Stores and analyzes results for each vigilance parameter.
- **Confusion Matrix Plotting**: Function to visualize confusion matrix.
- **Main Function**: Integrates all functions for ease of use.
- **Cluster ID Printing**: Displays cluster IDs assigned during each vigilance parameter.

### Standard ART1 Algorithm (with Libraries)

- Standard implementation with the help of libraries for functionality.

### Standard ART1 Algorithm (with NumPy)

- Pure implementation using only NumPy, without any other external libraries.

## Results

The implementations provide insights into the behavior and performance of the ART1 algorithm under different configurations. Key results include:

- Visualization of confusion matrices
- Analysis of cluster assignments
- Performance metrics for different vigilance parameters
